# Dynamic Programming Problems

## Arrays/Strings

DP problems often involve an optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. The solutions build up from smaller, solved subproblems to the final answer. Arrays are a natural fit for DP because they provide a simple way to store computed states.

* **Easy:**
    1.  [53] Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm, a classic DP approach)
    2.  [70] Climbing Stairs
    3.  [121] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    4.  [118] Pascal's Triangle
    5.  [303] Range Sum Query - Immutable (Can also be solved with DP, where `dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[i-1]`)
    6.  [645] Set Mismatch

* **Medium:**
    7.  [64] Minimum Path Sum
    8.  [139] Word Break
    9.  [300] Longest Increasing Subsequence
    10. [5] Longest Palindromic Substring
    11. [152] Maximum Product Subarray
    12. [91] Decode Ways
    13. [198] House Robber
    14. [213] House Robber II
    15. [718] Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray
