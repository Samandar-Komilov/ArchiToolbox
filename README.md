Data Structures and Algorithms are crucial in System Design, especially while building large scale, high load applications. So, I'm far from calling not to solve any LeetCode problems. But we have to learn WHY that particular algorithm, data structure or method is needed, instead of simply memorizing it.

This repository is dedicated to my LeetCode problem solutions and potentially, a real world implementations (at least I try) of the patterns and structures.
