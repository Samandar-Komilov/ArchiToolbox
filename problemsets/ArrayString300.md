### Prefix Sum

Prefix sum is an **orthogonal additive technique** that becomes powerful **when combined with hashmaps** to remember cumulative states.

### Sorting & Partitioning

Sorting & partitioning isn’t just about calling `sort()`.
It’s the **mechanics** behind order transformations — the physical reorganization of data.
The core ideas:

* Sorting = establishing global order by local comparisons.
* Partitioning = locally separating elements based on a rule (pivot, parity, sign, etc.).
  Together, they form the *skeleton* of many algorithms: quicksort, mergesort, Dutch flag, selection problems, rearrangements, and order-statistics.
  You master this by learning to reason about *invariants* and *boundaries* in-place.

#### Basic Sorting Logic

1. Implement bubble sort manually.
2. Implement insertion sort manually.
3. Implement selection sort manually.
4. Implement merge sort (top-down recursion).
5. Implement merge sort (bottom-up iterative).
6. Implement quicksort (choose first element as pivot).
7. Implement quicksort (random pivot).
8. Implement counting sort (non-comparison integer sort).
9. Implement radix sort (for integers and strings).
10. Implement bucket sort for floats in range [0, 1).

*Goal:* build raw sorting reflex and memory of invariants (left ≤ pivot ≤ right, etc.).

#### Partitioning

11. Partition array into <pivot | pivot | >pivot (core quicksort step).
12. Partition array into negatives and non-negatives (two pointers).
13. Partition array into evens and odds.
14. Partition array by value k (less than k first).
15. Sort colors (Dutch National Flag: 0s, 1s, 2s).
16. Stable partition array by parity (preserve order).
17. Segregate 0s and 1s in binary array.
18. Move all zeros to the end, keeping order.
19. Partition array so that all elements ≤ pivot appear before pivot, others after, in place.
20. Partition array into elements <, =, > median using two pointers.

*Goal:* understand local reordering, boundary maintenance, pointer movement logic.

#### Sorting + Partition Hybrid Applications

21. Find Kth smallest element using quickselect (partition + recursion).
22. Find Kth largest element (variation).
23. Sort array by absolute value.
24. Sort array by frequency of elements.
25. Sort array by number of set bits in binary representation.

*Goal:* manipulate sorting criteria; internalize “custom comparator” thinking.

#### Partial Sorting & Reordering Patterns

26. Merge two sorted arrays in place without extra space.
27. Rearrange positive and negative numbers alternately (maintaining relative order).
28. Sort array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in one pass (optimized Dutch flag).
29. Sort array by distance from a given value x.
30. Find smallest k elements in array (partial heap + partition hybrid).

*Goal:* learn controlled reordering — not full sorting, but localized rearrangement.

!!! note
    Partitioning teaches *movement invariants*; sorting teaches *comparison invariants.*
    Together, they underpin binary search ordering, two-pointer rearrangements, selection problems, and memory-efficient data manipulation — everything from quicksort internals to load balancing.
