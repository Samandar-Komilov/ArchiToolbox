# 🧠 DSA Mastery Plan (Builder-Focused)

**Duration:** May – December 2025
**Reference Book:** *Data Structures and Algorithms in Python* by Goodrich
**Focus:** Master DSA via implementation and integration in real-world systems (Nginx, Redis, SQLite)

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Move from paper-level knowledge to deep implementation and real-world application.
* Master DSA not for interviews, but for system building as a future software architect.
* Learn to integrate DSA directly into full systems (Redis, SQLite).

---

## 🗓️ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Structures (May)

### Topics:

* Python list and string internals (array-based structures)
* Linked lists (singly/doubly/circular)
* Stack & Queue (including deque)
* Recursion fundamentals

### Actions:

* Implement all from scratch in Python first, then try C (wherever relevant to Nginx).
* Solve book exercises + 2-3 practical problems per week.

### Mini Projects:

* Text buffer using Gap Buffer (array)
* Stack/Queue visualization CLI

---

## 🗓️ Phase 2: Sorting & Recursion Patterns (June)

### Topics:

* Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort
* Recursive tree structures

### Actions:

* Implement all sorts (focus on shifting and memory visualization)
* Learn and build binary trees (heap, BST, AVL basics)

### Mini Projects:

* CLI File sorter by size, date
* BST visualizer / CLI search tool

---

## 🗓️ Phase 3: Trees Deep Dive (July)

### Topics:

* Binary Search Trees (insert/delete/search)
* AVL/Red-Black overview (optional full impl.)
* Tree traversals
* Expression trees / syntax trees

### Mini Projects:

* Command suggester via BST/Trie
* Syntax parser for simple math language
* Merge sort implementation for log parsing in Nginx

---

## 🗓️ Phase 4: Graphs & Heaps (August)

### Topics:

* Adjacency list/matrix
* BFS, DFS, Topo sort
* Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford
* Min/Max Heap, Priority Queues

### Mini Projects:

* Network router simulation
* Task dependency scheduler (for Redis/SQLite builds)

---

## 🗓️ Phase 5: Real-World System Models (September)

### Topics:

* HashMaps (chaining + open addressing)
* Trie
* Union-Find (disjoint sets)
* LRU Cache (linked list + hashmap)

### Mini Projects:

* Build Redis-like key-value store (Phase 1 of Redis project)
* Trie-based autocomplete/search engine
* Simulate session storage (auth system with LRU)

---

## 🗓️ Phase 6: Redis & SQLite Integration (October–December)

### Redis Build Focus:

* HashMap with chaining
* Expiry system using heap
* Command parsing (string splitting, token trees)
* LRU eviction strategy

### SQLite Build Focus:

* B-Trees for indexing
* Trie or suffix trees for LIKE pattern matching
* Query optimizer (basic DAG/graph modeling)

## 📚 Weekly Schedule

| Day     | Focus                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mon     | Read book + implement concept |
| Tue     | Solve 2 real-world problems   |
| Wed     | Build mini component          |
| Thu     | Reimplement in C if relevant  |
| Fri     | Review & refactor             |
| Weekend | Project integration           |

---

## ✅ Tracking Progress

Create a GitHub repo:

* `/implementations/` — DSA from scratch in Python & C
* `/projects/` — Real-world use mini systems
* `/notes/` — Markdown notes, diagrams, learnings
* Use issues + milestones to track each phase

---

## Final Goal by December 2025

You should be able to:

* Build Redis and SQLite-like systems from scratch
* Implement all major DSA components in Python and C
* Make architectural decisions based on algorithmic tradeoffs
* Interview confidently and build real-world systems with DSA mastery
