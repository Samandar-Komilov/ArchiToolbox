# üîÅ Core Techniques in Array-Based Sequences
## Prefix Sum

Use: Range sum queries, subarray calculations.
Variants: 1D Prefix Sum, 2D Prefix Sum, Difference Array (for range updates).
Applications: Subarray sum equals K, imos method in optimization.

## Two Pointers

Use: Sorted array problems, subarray searching, partitioning logic.
Variants: Fast-slow pointer, shrinking/growing window.
Applications: Merge intervals, removing duplicates, palindrome checking.

## Sliding Window

Use: Fixed-size or variable-size window on array/string.
Applications: Maximum sum subarray, longest substring without repeating characters.

## Binary Search on Arrays

Use: Find element, boundaries (first/last occurrence), custom conditions.
Variants: Left-bound/right-bound binary search, binary search on answer.
Applications: Peak element, capacity to ship packages within D days.

## In-place Shifting and Swapping

Use: Rotating array, reversing, cyclic replacements.
Applications: Move zeroes, rotate array, in-place merge.

## Difference Arrays (Range Updates)

Use: Efficient range updates using difference and prefix logic.
Applications: Range addition, interval overlapping.

## Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm

Use: Max subarray sum in O(n).
Applications: Real-time log monitoring, temperature drop detection.

## Dutch National Flag Partitioning

Use: Multi-way partitioning, 3-way quicksort, color sorting.
Applications: Sorting 0s, 1s, and 2s; bucket separation.

## Reservoir Sampling

Use: Pick random element from a stream.
Application: System monitoring tools (e.g., Redis sampling).

## Prefix XOR / Bitmask Patterns

Use: Subarrays with certain XOR conditions.
Applications: Security, encoding, segment checksum tools.
